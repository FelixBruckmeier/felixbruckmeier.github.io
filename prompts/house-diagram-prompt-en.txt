Design a clean, modern house diagram infographic consistent with a minimalist product website UI (rounded corners, soft shadows, subtle grid).
Requirements:
- Roof (triangle above): label “Sustainable Products”.
- Five clickable pillars rendered as rounded cards (not tall classical columns). Each card shows a title and short caption; on hover it elevates slightly.
- Pillar order from left to right (and top-to-bottom scrolling order on the page): About → Expertise → Projects → Craft → Contact (navigation mirrors page sections).
- Foundation (rounded bar below the cards) labeled “User-Centered Value Creation”.
- The five cards are:
  1) Research Strategy — “Discovery programs aligned to business goals”
  2) Needs → Product Strategy — “Translate insights into roadmaps”
  3) Process & Tooling — “Efficient, scalable research practice”
  4) Team Leadership — “Mentorship, standards, culture of excellence”
  5) Proving ROI — “Measure and communicate impact”
- Color palette: neutral background, accessible contrast; blues/greys for structure.
- Output: vector-friendly layout with clear spacing, rounded 20–24px radii, no decorative clutter.
- Ensure the roof sits ABOVE the cards (not inverted) and the foundation sits BELOW.
