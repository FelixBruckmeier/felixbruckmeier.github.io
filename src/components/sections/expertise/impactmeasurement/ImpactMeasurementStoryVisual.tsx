            Many organizations prioritize short-term KPIs such as <strong>conversion</strong>,{" "}
            <strong>efficiency</strong>, or <strong>revenue</strong>. Long-term value drivers like{" "}
            <strong>trust</strong>, <strong>satisfaction</strong>, and <strong>loyalty</strong> are
            rarely tracked systematically.
            <br />
            <br />
            As a result, UX is often perceived as a soft discipline ‚Äî disconnected from business
            impact. Leadership may acknowledge its importance, yet UX KPIs rarely influence
            decision-making. The outcome: investments flow toward quick wins instead of
            sustainable customer relationships.

        title="3Ô∏è‚É£ Challenge ‚Äì Why measuring UX remains difficult"
        text={
          <>
            Measuring UX is inherently complex. Unlike sales or conversion rates, UX outcomes are{" "}
            <strong>indirect</strong> ‚Äî a combination of <strong>quantitative</strong> and{" "}
            <strong>qualitative</strong> signals such as satisfaction, trust, and ease-of-use.
            <br />
            <br />
            Even when teams collect data, those signals live in different units: NPS, completion
            time, perceived confidence, etc. To act on them, organizations must{" "}
            <strong>normalize and translate</strong> those signals into a unified performance
            metric ‚Äî a process that requires analytics, governance, and time.
            <br />
            <br />
            Frameworks like Google‚Äôs <strong>HEART model</strong> are suitable tools for this
            translation, but adopting them requires organizational maturity and leadership buy-in.

        text={
          <>
            When a full measurement system is not yet in place ‚Äî or leadership needs a clear,
            fundable argument ‚Äî I make UX impact visible using simple financial logic. This
            pragmatic route complements later, more complete frameworks.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Example 1 ‚Äî CLTV impact through UX optimization</strong>
            <br />
            Assume ‚Äî as McKinsey suggests ‚Äî that roughly <strong>32% of customers</strong> do not
            return after a bad experience. With a user base of <strong>3.2 million</strong> and an
            average <strong>CLTV of ‚Ç¨30</strong>, the potential annual revenue at risk is:
            <br />
            <br />
            <em>3,200,000 √ó 0.32 √ó ‚Ç¨30 = ‚Ç¨30,720,000</em>
            <br />
            <br />
            If targeted UX work can retain just <strong>10% of these at-risk customers</strong>, the
            recovered revenue would be:
            <br />
            <br />
            <em>‚Ç¨30,720,000 √ó 0.10 = ‚Ç¨3,072,000</em>
            <br />
            <br />
            In short: a modest UX effect (10% retention of the at-risk cohort) yields over{" "}
            <strong>‚Ç¨3M per year</strong> ‚Äî and that is before considering any marketing or sales
            costs.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Example 2 ‚Äî Usability improvement ‚Üí efficiency gains</strong>
            <br />
            Consider an internal task that currently takes <strong>5m30s</strong> and is executed by{" "}
            <strong>400 employees</strong> on average <strong>3 times per day</strong>. After a UX
            redesign the task takes <strong>2m15s</strong>, saving <strong>3m15s</strong> per run.
            Annual saved time:
            <br />
            <br />
            <em>3.25 minutes √ó 3 √ó 400 employees √ó 220 workdays = 856,800 minutes</em>
            <br />
            ‚âà <strong>14,280 hours / year</strong>
            <br />
            <br />
            At an average internal rate of <strong>‚Ç¨40 / hour</strong> this equals:
            <br />
            <br />
            <em>14,280 √ó ‚Ç¨40 = ‚Ç¨571,200</em>
            <br />
            <br />
            These two short, transparent calculations create fundable business cases that make UX
            a visible lever while the organization builds a comprehensive measurement system like
            HEART.
