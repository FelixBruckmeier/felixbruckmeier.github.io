      <SectionIntro>
        UX Research is not a one-time effort but a continuous learning process
        throughout the product lifecycle. As a UX Research Lead, I create systems
        that connect discovery, validation, and optimization â€” enabling teams to
        learn faster and make confident, user-centered decisions.
