      <SectionIntro>
        Strategic UX Research doesnâ€™t end with insight â€” it connects learning to direction.
        UX Research OKRs link research efforts directly to company strategy, ensuring that
        what teams discover also shapes what the organization pursues.
        <div className="my-6"></div>
        Instead of existing as a side activity, research becomes part of how strategic priorities
        are defined, measured, and evolved.
        <div className="my-6"></div>
        By aligning learning goals with business objectives, I turn UX Research into a steering
        mechanism â€” one that helps organizations see user evidence not as validation, but as
        orientation. At this level, research informs not just how we build, but why.
        <div className="my-6"></div>
        One might ask â€” isnâ€™t that too good to be true?
        <div className="my-6"></div>
        And yes, UX as a leading force within business strategy doesnâ€™t happen overnight.
        Itâ€™s a gradual, sometimes rocky journey â€” one thatâ€™s best understood in levels:

          Having UX Research OKRs is good â€” but even better is when UX Research itself contributes
          directly to defining company OKRs. Thatâ€™s when research moves beyond validation to become
          a strategic driver â€” ensuring that what the organization measures truly reflects what
          users value.
